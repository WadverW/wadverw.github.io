The code of this site was mostly written with Sass. I got the model of the site from the frontend cours in Udemy. 
I watched the way the mentor coded, but surely i made significant part on my own. 
Some elements were made with Bootstrap library, and it`s the very single model I`ve done with Bootstrap. Because I prefer to deal with flexbox and grids via preprocessor scss. 
I have an expirience in worcking with Less and Sass as well.
